            <p>
                Hello! I’m Amogh Kashyap, currently doing BTECH as a fresher in RV University. 
                I received my primary education from Freedom International School and graduated 
                high school from Delhi Public School. I was always so keen on machine learning, 
                and AI almost always drew my attention. This interest was cultivated in me majorly 
                through academic exposure, hands-on projects and also self exploration. My education
                provided me with the firm foundation to delve more into studying the algorithms, 
                programming languages, etc. I’ve taken part in many coding competitions held by various 
                institutions. Even if I didn’t win every time, it was the new learning that I picked up 
                on the way that piqued my curiosity.
